These are meant to be a companion to the lecture that explains the main idea behind the algorithm.\n\n\nGiven a _sorted_ list (assume ascending order sorted) of $n$ elements, we wish to find out if a given element `elt` belongs to the list. \n\nBinary search algorithm repeatedly narrows down the possible location of the element by comparing the middle element in the search range to the one we are searching for. We are hoping to find at each step using the fact that the array is sorted.\n\n**TODO** Look at the lecture on binary search before you proceed further.\n\n\nWe wish to  implement a function `binarySearchHelper(lst, elt, left, right)` wherein:\n  - `lst` is a non empty list with at least 2 or more elements.\n  - `elt` is the element whose index we are searching for.\n  - `left` and `right` represent the \"bounds\" in terms of indices of the list.\n    - Note that indices in python start at 0 and go until `len(lst)`. \n    - Let us use `n` to denote the length of the list.\n    - We will always ensure that 0 <= `left` <= `right` <= n-1. \n    \nThe expected output is a number `index` or the python value `None`.\n  - If a number `index` is returned, it is a valid index of the list between left and right AND `lst[index] == elt` must hold.\n  - Otherwise, `None` is returned if and only if the list `lst` does not contain `elt`.\n  \nHere is the implementation of `binarySearchHelper`."

Since at the very beginning, we have `left = 0` andd `right = n-1`. The statement is trivially true: if `elt` belongs to the list, then its index must be between `0` and `n-1`.\n\n**Induction:** If a given call to `binarySearchHelper` satisfies these facts then the subsequent call must also satisfy these properties.\n\nTo prove this let us take a careful look at the body of the function in question.\n```python\nmid = (left + right)//2 # Note that // is integer division \nif lst[mid] == elt: \n    return mid \nelif lst[mid] < elt:  \n    return binarySearchHelper(lst, elt, mid+1, right) ## CALL 1\nelse: # lst[mid] > elt\n    return binarySearchHelper(lst, elt, left, mid-1) ## CALL 2\n```\n\nNote that there are two calls back to `binarySearchHelper` labeled `CALL 1` andd `CALL 2` in the body.\n  - For CALL 1, note that it can happen only if `lst[mid] < elt`. Since `lst` is sorted, if `elt` were to be found in the list, it can only be found in the range of indices `[mid+1, right]`. Therefore, the property continues to hold for CALL 1.\n  - For CALL 2, note that it can happen only if `lst[mid] > elt`. Therefore, if the `elt` were to be found in the list, it can only be found in the range of indices `[left, mid-1]`. Therefore, the property continues to hold for CALL 2."

Note,\n`mid >= left` or in other words, `mid > left - 1`.\nTherefore, the new search region size is `right - mid < right - (left -1) = right -left + 1`. Thus, the new call's search region is strictly smaller than the original call's search region.\n\n\nNote that for CALL 2, the new search region size is `mid - left`. Once again since `mid <= right`, we note that `mid < right + 1`. Therefore, `mid - left < right + 1 - left`. Thus, the new call's search region is strictly smaller than the original call's search region.\n"

Similarly, we write `m` instead of `mid`).\n```python\nm = (left + right)//2 # Note that // is integer division \nif lst[m] == elt: \n    return mid \nelif lst[m] < elt:  \n    return binarySearchHelper(lst, elt, m+1, r) ## CALL 1\nelse: # lst[mid] > elt\n    return binarySearchHelper(lst, elt, l, m-1) ## CALL 2\n```\n\nAny subsequent call is either CALL 1 or CALL 2.\n\n  - For CALL 1, the new search region size is \n  $$ r- (m+1) +1 = r - m = r - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{(l + r)}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\leq r - \\frac{(l+r-1)}{2} \\leq \\frac{(r - l + 1)}{2} $$ \n  - For CALL 2, the new search region size is \n  $$ (m -1) - l + 1 = m - l = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{(l + r)}{2} \\right\\rfloor - l \\leq \\frac{(l+r)}{2} - l  \\leq \\frac{(r - l)}{2} \\leq \\frac{(r-l + 1)}{2} $$.\n  \nIn both cases, we derive the relation that new search region is less than or equal to half the size of the old search region."

Thus, we concluded that  the running time is bounded from above by $O(\\log(n))$.\n\nA similar analysis shows that for every $n$, we can produce a list of size $n$ and a missing element such that the algorithm must take time proportional to $\\log_2(n)$ to run.
